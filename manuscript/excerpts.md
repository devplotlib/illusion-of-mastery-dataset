# Draft Manuscript Excerpts

These excerpts represent preliminary sections of a future manuscript based on the Illusion of Mastery Longitudinal Error Corpus (IMLEC). They are polished, standalone paragraphs intended for eventual integration into a full research paper.

## 1. Theoretical Framing

Learners construct judgments of understanding from cues that are often only loosely related to conceptual correctness. Familiarity, linguistic fluency, and the apparent smoothness of a solution can function as metacognitive signals that inflate confidence even when reasoning is incomplete or flawed. This project examines how these signals contribute to the illusion of mastery: a persistent divergence between perceived understanding and actual performance. By analyzing patterns of error, confidence, and revision behavior across solo, human-guided, and AI-assisted settings, the study situates the illusion of mastery within a broader theory of metacognitive calibration.

## 2. Rationale for the Dataset

Conventional learning datasets typically encode correctness but lack information about how learners reason through tasks, how they respond to feedback, and how they assess their own understanding. The IMLEC dataset was constructed to address this limitation by capturing not only learner outputs, but also the structure of their errors, their confidence levels, their interactions with feedback, and the influence of AI assistance on their reasoning. This richer representation allows for the analysis of both cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of learning, making it possible to investigate how misconceptions form, persist, and evolve over time.

## 3. Preliminary Observations

Early analyses reveal a consistent pattern: confidence remains high even when conceptual reasoning is incorrect. The effect is especially pronounced in AI-assisted contexts, where polished linguistic structure appears to serve as a misleading cue of understanding. Learners frequently adopt AI phrasing or explanation patterns without assimilating the underlying conceptual logic. This suggests that linguistic fluency may compete with conceptual structure as a dominant cue in learners’ metacognitive evaluations. Additionally, the most persistent errors involve the misapplication of previously learned rules to structurally incompatible tasks, indicating that misconceptions often originate from overgeneralized heuristics rather than gaps in knowledge.

## 4. Feedback Dynamics

The relationship between feedback timing and conceptual improvement appears asymmetric. Immediate feedback improves procedural accuracy but produces limited shifts in conceptual understanding, while delayed feedback encourages more reflective revisions but with higher variability in outcome quality. In several instances, learners revised their responses before receiving feedback, suggesting that uncertainty may trigger spontaneous reevaluation even in the absence of external cues. These dynamics highlight the need to differentiate between procedural correction and conceptual restructuring when evaluating the effectiveness of feedback.

## 5. Implications for AI-Assisted Learning

The dataset suggests that AI systems influence not only the content of learner responses but also their metacognitive cues. Exposure to AI-generated structure and phrasing tends to elevate confidence levels regardless of correctness, which may hinder recalibration after errors. If learners interpret linguistic fluency as a marker of understanding, they may become less sensitive to conceptual gaps in their reasoning. This raises important considerations for designing AI systems that support rather than distort metacognitive accuracy. Effective instructional design will require mechanisms that foreground conceptual structure over surface-level fluency.

## 6. Summary Insight

Taken together, the findings point to a consistent pattern: surface cues exert disproportionate influence on learners’ judgments of understanding. Whether these cues arise from familiarity, linguistic polish, or prior rule recall, they can mask structural weaknesses in reasoning and encourage overconfident errors. The illusion of mastery thus emerges not as an incidental quirk but as a predictable consequence of how learners interpret the signals available to them during problem solving.
